  ## Description

  Note Taker is a simple note taking app built with Express.js. The app had a few issues related to Node.js that prevented it from functioning properly. My task was to debug the site and get it working again. I started by adding some get routes for the `home` and `note` pages to display the html. Then created GET, POST, and DELETE routes to give the user the ability to save/delete notes.

  Application Delopyed with Heroku: https://obscure-reaches-63415.herokuapp.com/
